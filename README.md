This cookbook contains loose recipes that for whatever reason didn't fit in any other cookbook. It also serves as an incubator to try things out and perhaps move recipes into their own cookbook as they mature.

Recipes in this cookbook very specifically solve one of *my* needs, so expect hard coded values etc. Double check what a recipe does before using it.

Currently included

* make_backups : Basic script + cron job for making a daily dump of PostgreSQL databases
* spideroak : Install SpiderOak binary from their APT repo (Ubuntu or Debian)
